[Problem description]
You are given an array arr of positive integers. You are also given the array queries where queries[i] = [left\_i, right\_i].

For each query i compute the XOR of elements from lefti to righti (that is, arr[left\_i] XOR arr[lefti + 1] XOR ... XOR arr[right\_i] ).

Return an array answer where answer[i] is the answer to the ith query.

[Attempts]

At first I tried to sort by dictionary order the queries, s.t. I could do something like this (numbers are indices):

```
[123]
[1234]
 [23456]
  [3456]
```

Such that the subsequent scan could be done in linear time (just move the start/back indices and supposedly they are monotone).

Unfortunately this ain't true, consider the following (here pairs are indices are in `[start, back]`):

```
[[0, 1], [0, 3], [1, 2]]
```

I.e. while dictionary order ensures that the starting index is monotone, the back indice is NOT.

While this could've been solved, we'd still need to recover the original order, which is cumbersome: the problem indicates that ordering matters.

[Solution]

Store prefix-sum.
