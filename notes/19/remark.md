# 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List

Note that the `as` operator in rust can do either explicit coersion or a set of determined conversions; if not the two kinds mentioned it's compilation error.
Specifically, for `i32 as u32` where *size equal*, [it's good-old 2's complement](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/expressions/operator-expr.html) and hence no-op most of the time.
